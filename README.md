# Snake-Game

This program runs a snake game within the terminal.

Snake is a game in which the player tries to survive as long as possible. The player moves in cardinal directions with w, a, s, d. If the player runs into the boundaries of the game, or runs into their own tail, the game is over. To collect points, the player must collect fruit that are randomly generated throughout the matrix that the player can move in. 

This was developed in Microsoft Visual Studios
